# lightMatterMC_PyF90
Monte-Carlo simulation of up to 3 atoms inside an optical dipole trap + light-matter interaction.
Implementation of the classical dynamics and stochastic photon absorption / re-emission is done with Fortran 90 and compiled as a Python library.
Code initialization, parallelization and execution is performed via a wrapper in Python.
